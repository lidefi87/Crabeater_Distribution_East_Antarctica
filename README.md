# Estimating past crabeater seal distribution in East Antarctica
Estimating past crabeater seal (*Lobodon carcinophagus*) distribution in East Antarctica in November (breeding) and December (post-breeding) using a species distribution model ensemble.  
  
To train our models, we used publicly available crabeater presence data between December 1981 and December 2013. Environmental data came from two sources: (1) remotely-sensed data, and a high resolution coupled sea ice-ocean model, ACCESS-OM2-01.  
  
This repository includes all scripts developed to estimate the habitat distribution of crabeater seals.
